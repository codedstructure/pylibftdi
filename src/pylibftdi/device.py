        Device([device_id[, mode, [OPTIONS ...]]) -> Device instance

        represents a single FTDI device accessible via the libftdi driver.
        Supports a basic file-like interface (open/close/read/write, context
        manager support).

        :param device_id: an optional serial number of the device to open.
            if omitted, this refers to the first device found, which is
            convenient if only one device is attached, but otherwise
            fairly useless.

        :param mode: either 'b' (binary) or 't' (text). This primarily affects
            Python 3 calls to read() and write(), which will accept/return
            unicode strings which will be encoded/decoded according to the given...

        :param encoding: the codec name to be used for text operations.

        :param interface_select: select interface to use on multi-interface devices

        :param device_index: optional index of the device to open, in the
            event of multiple matches for other parameters (PID, VID,
            device_id). Defaults to zero (the first device found).

        The following parameters are only available as keyword parameters
        and override class attributes, so may be specified in subclasses.

        :param lazy_open: if True, then the device will not be opened immediately -
            the user must perform an explicit open() call prior to other
            operations.

        :param chunk_size: if non-zero, split read and write operations into chunks
            of this size. With large or slow accesses, interruptions (i.e.
            KeyboardInterrupt) may not happen in a timely fashion.

        :param auto_detach: default True, whether to automatically re-attach
            the kernel driver on device close.

        :param index: optional index into list_devices() to open.
            Useful in the event that multiple devices of differing VID/PID
            are attached, where `device_index` is insufficient to select
            as device indexing restarts at 0 for each VID/PID combination.
